A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. Previously, the wipers had to be manually activated by changing the frequency. The operation of increasing the wiper speed is modified as a result. The project's purpose is to improve the systems of older cars by providing automated transmission. wiping technology, to improve the system by including a sensor and actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would work with the system completely. the structure The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers. Regardless of the fact that To drain water from the windscreen, this system will be updated to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface.
# INTRODUCTION
 
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 STM32 CUBE IDE
# COMPONENTS
  STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## DESCRIPTION
# STM32F407VG
The STM32F407 Kit makes it simple for users to construct audio-based applications by utilising the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities. It includes an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector. The STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit now includes Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features. The Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC processor, which works at up to 168 MHz, is at the heart of the STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families.
 # FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
 * The STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller contains a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM in a LQFP100 package.
* STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 on-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A (new order code)
* USB ST-LINK with three different interfaces and the option to re-enumerate.
* Debug port for virtual com port (with new order code only)
* Large-scale archiving (with new order code only)
* Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source. * External application power supply is available in 3 V and 5 V.
 # USES
  * This microcontroller is used in printers and scanners, as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and security systems.
  *  This module can be found in a wide range of everyday items.
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume the microcontroller is the automobile. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) turns on, the wiper starts, and the second led (blue) turns on at the appropriate rate. The third led (green) will turn on if the button is pressed again, and the wiper speed will be increased in contrast to the previous one. The fourth press will activate the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in accordance with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.

# WHAT IS WIPER SYSTEM
Windscreen wipers are required for the driver to have a clear view, especially in modern high-speed vehicles.

# WHY WIPER SYSTEM
To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.

# WHEN SHOULD USE WIPER SYSTEM
The windshield wipers clear the windshield of rain and snow, and the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO DISCOVERED WIPER SYSTEM
Mark Anderson invented on 1902
